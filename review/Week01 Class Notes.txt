        Asynchronious Programming:
				Promises
				Async & Await

Dynamicly Typed Programming Language: JavaScript, Python 

    interpreter ==> during the run time

    let variableName;


Static Typed Programming Language: Java, C, C#, C++, TypeScript

    Compiler ==> during the compile time

    int variableName;


Promises: future value/error (50/50)
    represnets the value that will ve availabe either now, or in future, or never


Task01:
    Make promise  (pending state)
    step1
    step2
    step3
    step4
    step5
    step6
    return value;


Task02:
    step1
    step2
    step3 (needs the value of task01 returning) ===> Await for the promised value
    step4
    step5

Task03:
    step1
    step2
    step3 (needs the value of task01 returning) ===> Await for the promised value

Task04:
    step1
    step2
    step3 (needs the value of task01 returning) ===> Await for the promised value
    step4

Word Break Problem
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented
into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. See following examples for more details.
This is a famous Google interview question, also being asked by many other companies now a days.
Consider the following dictionary
    { i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice, cream, icecream, man, go, mango}
    Input:  ilike
    Output: Yes
    The string can be segmented as "i like".

    Input:  ilikesamsung
    Output: Yes
    The string can be segmented as "i like samsung" or "i like sam sung".



Create a function that can Count of substrings having all distinct characters
        Given a string str consisting of lowercase alphabets, the task is to find the number of possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that consists of distinct characters only.
            Examples:
                Input: Str = “gffg”
                Output: 6
        Explanation:
            All possible substrings from the given string are,
            ( “g“, “gf“, “gff”, “gffg”, “f“, “ff”, “ffg”, “f“, “fg“, “g” )
            Among them, the highlighted ones ( “g“, “gf“, “f“, “f“, “fg“, “g” ) consists of distinct characters only.

                Input: str = “gfg”
                Output: 5
        Explanation:
            All possible substrings from the given string are,
            ( “g“, “gf“, “gfg”, “f“, “fg“, “g” )
            Among them, the highlighted ( “g“, “gf“, “f“, “fg“, “g” ) consists of distinct characters only.




Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
        1 2 3
        4 5 6
        9 8 9

    Output:
        The absolute difference is: 2
